# Exploring Trophic Analysis for Directed Biological Networks
This code is used to conduct the analysis and produce the figures shown in the MSc project "Exploring Trophic Analysis for Directed Biological Networks" [1] by Sarah Andrews.  Trophic analysis was conducted using an adapted version of the code by Bazil Sansom (2020) [2], licensed under the MIT License. There are two toolboxes provided within this repository: "trophic_tools" [1, 2], and "mouse_plot" [1, 3]. There are also two files with code for producing the relevant figures: "FCN_Trophic_Analysis" [1, 2, 3], and "GRN_Trophic_Analysis" [1, 2]. Please refer to the individual files for more information on how to use them.
